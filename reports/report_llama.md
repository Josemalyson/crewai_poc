## Business Rules
### Key Rules
- **Rule 1**: The chatbot should respond to user queries in a friendly and informative manner.
- **Rule 2**: The chatbot should prioritize accurate information over conversational flow.
- **Rule 3**: The chatbot should not engage in discussions that may be considered sensitive or off-topic.

*These rules ensure that we meet the project goals and maintain consistency throughout our development process.*
