Business Rules
================

* The system should be able to understand natural language inputs from users.
* The system should be able to respond to user inputs in a human-like manner.
* The system should be able to store user data and conversation history in a database.

Project Architecture
================

MyChatBot uses a microservices architecture with the following components:

* Natural Language Processing (NLP) Service
* Machine Learning (ML) Service
* Dialog Management Service

The NLP Service is responsible for parsing user input, while the ML Service handles intent detection and response generation. The Dialog Management Service manages the conversation flow.

The system also uses a database to store user data and conversation history.

Technologies and Frameworks
================

* Programming Language: Python
* Web Framework: Flask
* Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow
* Natural Language Processing Framework: PyTorch

Build Instructions
================

1. Install the required packages using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Build the NLP, ML, and Dialog Management Services using the provided Dockerfiles: `docker-compose build`
3. Start the services using the provided shell scripts: `./start.sh`

Deployment Instructions
================

1. Deploy the services to a cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud.
2. Configure the services to communicate with each other.
3. Monitor the services using a monitoring tool such as Prometheus.

Environment Variables
================

* `NLP_SERVICE_HOST`: The host URL of the NLP Service.
* `ML_SERVICE_HOST`: The host URL of the ML Service.
* `DIALOG_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE_HOST`: The host URL of the Dialog Management Service.
* `DATABASE_URL`: The URL of the database.

API Documentation
================
