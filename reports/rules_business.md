**Introduction:**
MyChatBot is a conversational AI designed to simulate human-like conversations using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to understand and respond to user inputs.

**Programmes Languages:** 
- Python
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

* The system should be able to understand natural language inputs from users.
* The system should be able to respond to user inputs in a human-like manner.
* The system should be able to store user data and conversation history in a database.

**Project Architecture:**
MyChatBot uses a microservices architecture with the following components:
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) Service: Parses user input
* Machine Learning (ML) Service: Handles intent detection and response generation
* Dialog Management Service: Manages the conversation flow

The system also uses a database to store user data and conversation history.

**Technologies and Frameworks:**
* Flask
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch

**Build Instructions:**
1. Install the required packages using pip.
2. Build the NLP, ML, and Dialog Management Services using the provided Dockerfiles.
3. Start the services using the provided shell scripts.

**Deployment Instructions:**
1. Deploy the services to a cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud.
2. Configure the services to communicate
